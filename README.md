I developed an application that allows a user to learn more details about the destination of their
choice including geographical location, points of interest, and the distance to those points. The
application has a file system storage and is in C++. After conceptualization, I managed a fourperson
team and learned how to divide the implementation work, coordinate on design, and work
together to test in order to deliver a successful project.
